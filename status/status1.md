Progress Update 1

-----

1. **Recap:**
   1. We spent this time getting all members to the same level of understanding with the technologies and math needed for us to complete this project. In our first meeting, we met to decide what platform we would create the application in and decided on Maui Blazor. In the second meeting we went over the algorithm for the Walsh-Hadamard Transform and solidified objectives for creating the initial application. All members were present for both meetings and contributed to the design decisions.
1. **Tasks completed:**
   1. General**:** All members were tasked with finding resources regarding the technologies/math needed to create this application. We are focusing on creating a uniform understanding of the app in general with each member focusing on some point of interest that will best benefit the group. 
   1. Derik: Post WH and Fourier resources, get algorithm planned out with roadmap
   1. Kain: Research WHT and Fourier transforms in general
   1. Chet: C# experimentation, Familiarize with Maui Blazor
   1. Calvin: Research WHT and Fourier transforms in general
   1. Finn: research Maui Blazor app setup, work on blazor and bootstrap demo 

1. **Successes:**
   1. Accomplishments:
      1. Rough outline
      1. Everyone seems to be getting up to speed well.
   1. Lessons:
      1. We need to focus on getting everyone’s vision for the project aligned.
1. **Roadblocks/challenges:**
   1. Challenges overcome:
      1. Getting everyone on the same page for the WH algorithm.
      1. Agreement on platform for coding.
      1. General outline for the application.
   1. Challenges remaining:
      1. IOS developer account needed to make IOS implementation viable.
      1. Solidify roles and responsibilities.
   1. Help Needed:
      1. Are there IOS developer accounts available to us already?
1. **Changes/Deviations:**
   1. We will now focus on getting the WH transform working entirely before adding other functionality. This means our initial goal will not include audio processing. 
   1. Initially we will use an existing FFT library instead of creating our own.
1. **Confidence:**
   1. Derik: 5 , I think we have a good roadmap and plan of action considering how early we are in the project.
   1. Finn: 5 I believe our initial project (WH implementation) is very doable in the allotted time. After that it will be a question on how much more we can accomplish.
   1. Calvin: 5, I believe there is a good amount of work for each person to contribute, and I definitely think we will complete our initial goals early. Then we can look into building more off of what we already have.
   1. Kain: 5, I understand my portion pretty well, whether or not i can program it is in question but we have a lot of time to debug it. 
   1. Chet: 5, It is realistic to think that we will complete the initial project in the time given to us.
1. **Group dynamics:**
   1. Derik: I feel like we have a great team. Everyone is enthusiastic and helpful. 
   1. Finn: Everyone appears to be motivated and committed. I believe the project will go smoothly in respect to the team.
   1. Calvin: Everyone is very involved and excited with the project, so I think we will work well and have some fun.
   1. Kain: We all work together well so far and basically know our jobs already.
   1. Chet: It's looking like everyone is enjoying the group so far, and there has been nothing we haven’t been able to figure out. This project will go smoothly in the coming months.
