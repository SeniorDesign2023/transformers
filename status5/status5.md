Status Update 5

-----
- **Recap:**

We settled on a theme and styling, added our navigation and organized the UI a bit. We are focusing more on the presentation now and have been deciding more precisely how we want to finish up this application. We are in the process of getting real, useful data to run through our transformation and will have a good basis for our presentation if that goes well. If we need to, we can still make some demo data with a few sine and cosine functions and random noise so we will see what works best for demonstration purposes this next sprint. Our presentation will likely focus on how data flows through the transform while using the tools we have created to explain each step. We are focusing on compression and noise filtering now so we should have a demonstration for each case. 

- **Tasks completed**
  - Description of tasks completed (and by whom)
    - General**:** Shrinking the scope of work again to ensure a strong finish and good presentation. Some work on audio processing and finding demo data. 
    - Derik: Looked into audio processing and general code help. Working on a presentation outline and getting demo data with Calvin.
    - Kain: Recorded audio samples for testing
    - Chet: Constructed functions to take data from the engine to the interface and vise-versa.
    - Calvin:  Searched for demo data and collaborated with Alicia for more data.
    - Finn: Completed base UI of the app and stubbed out additional pages. 
  - Metrics:
    - Meeting Count: 4
    - Approximate lines of code: 500 
    - PRs Completed: 3
- **Successes**
  - Accomplishments:
    - Styled the app
    - Getting closer to a final version
  - Solutions (Things we did that solved a problem):
    - Using a tabbed table to organize our input screen
  - Things we tried that didn’t work:
    - Audio is something we could likely implement with a library that we found, but we don’t think it will be worth the time needed to implement it.
- **Roadblocks/challenges**
  - Current challenges:
    - Presentation, this will start coming together as we get our example data and start working on the outline.
    - Final touches to the app
    - Need to figure out a small initialization issue.
  - Challenges overcome:
    - ` `Styling the app
    - Layout and navigation
    - Done with stretch goals, what we have added so far is enough to demonstrate the transformation and how we expect this app to be extended in the future.
  - Challenges remaining:
    - Condensing the explanation down to an elevator pitch.
  - Help Needed:
    - None really, might ask for input on our presentation materials and outline.
- **Changes/Deviations:**

No major deviations. We are very likely not doing audio but we will still discuss it and other possibilities in our presentation.

- **Next 3 Weeks:**
  - Finish the composition tab
  - Presentation
  - Testing final app
- **Confidence** on completion of the project for each team member and the group average
  - Derik: 5
  - Finn: 5
  - Calvin: 5
  - Kain: 5
  - Chet: 5
  - Average: 5
