Status Update 6

-----
- **Recap:**

During this iteration of the project we finalized the application and worked on the presentation. We reworked the flow of data through the app, giving users more freedom to sequentially modify their data. In addition, we decided to include a graph of the data every time the user makes a change so they can see exactly what is happening. Finally we tested the application with larger datasets and cleaned up bugs. The app is finished for the sake of this project but there is much more that can be accomplished in future updates. In addition to finishing the app we put a lot of work into the presentation. We finished a couple drafts and presented it to Ward. Based on his comments we made some more adjustments and we feel ready to present in class.

- **Tasks completed**
  - Description of tasks completed (and by whom)
    - General**:** Completed video and final presentations. Formatted the calculator to have full use of the Walsh and Hadamard libraries
    - Derik: Outlined the final calculator UI. Drafted presentation iterations.
    - Kain: Assisted with the video.
    - Chet: Added API functionality, worked on the video
    - Calvin:  Worked on presentation and project video. Worked with Derik and Finn to complete the filtering functionality.
    - Finn: Re-factored frontend to conform to new data flow outline. Fixed several bugs involved with the settings. 
  - Metrics:
    - Meeting Count: 4
    - Approximate lines of code: 500
    - PRs Completed: 3
- **Successes**
  - Accomplishments:
    - Final presentation done
    - Video done
    - Final touches to UI and data flow
  - Solutions (Things we did that solved a problem):
    - Adding more functionality between calculations helped the presentation make more sense.
  - Things we tried that didn’t work:
    - A few iterations of our presentation we tried did not work well.
- **Roadblocks/challenges**
  - Current challenges:
    - Input data could be more generic or we could add some kind of import functionality into the app to work with more data types.
  - Challenges overcome:
    - Fixed UI to better showcase the transformations as they happen.
    - Settled on a way to present the project. 
  - Challenges remaining:
    - Present at URID.
  - Help Needed:
    - More feedback on the presentation.
- **Changes/Deviations:**

Nothing major since last update. The application is set up to easily add more functionality and updates. The final product is just a trimmed version of our original plan still. 

- **Plan for Future Updates:**
  - Add Fast Fourier Transform library and functionality.
  - Add widgets like polyphonic tuner, spectral analyzer and wavelet techniques.
  - Make a more generic .json input.
  - Improve UX of the application.
- **Confidence** on completion of the project for each team member and the group average
  - Derik: 5
  - Finn: 5
  - Calvin: 5
  - Kain: 5
  - Chet: 5
